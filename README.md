This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## BAMBU Front End Test

- This Bambu front end test was created using create-react-app and is currently hosted on Firebase.

- The search query is based on the year 2019, using Alphavantage's TIME_SERIES_MONTHLY API which reflects a 12-month span of the stock market's price changes. Axios was used to fetch data from Alphavantage's API.

- The app's layout was designed using flexbox and is also mobile responsive. The graph was built using HTML5 Canvas.

- User's choice of stock can also be retained along with its data, leveraging Web Storage API's local storage mechanism.
